           <p>We know how important it is to make your pet’s surgery as
              PAINLESS and SAFE as possible. To maximize safety, we perform complimentary pre-anesthetic blood
              testing and both of our surgical suites are equipped with state of the art patient monitoring systems.
              Your pet will have a dedicated nurse monitoring them while they are sleeping. Our patients are always
              given oxygen throughout the entire surgery and have IV ports for fast access should they become
              compromised and. We believe that pain management is not an optional part of surgery; it is crucial, so
              we employ a “multi-modal” approach to pain. Most of our surgical patients receive local anesthetics to
              block pain in addition to receiving routine pre-anesthetic pain medication and additional, different post-
              operative pain medication that is often times prescribed for you to continue giving them once they go
              home.</p>
